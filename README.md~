# Modular Programming - INF1301

## Synopsis
This repository was created to aid the performance of the tasks proposed in Modular Programming, a class given to 
undergrads at PUC-Rio, Brazil.

## Members of the Team
The tasks should be solved in groups of 3. [Jordana Mecler](https://github.com/jordanamecler),[Me](https://github.com/egrinstein)
and [Leonardo Wajnsztok](https://github.com/leotok) composes our group.

## Projects:
### First project
The first project is located in the folder 'trabalho-1'. We were given the C code of a Binary Tree's ATD and implemented,
using modular programming techniques, a function to connect alphabetically the leaves of a tree. We also wrote a function to
print the leaves (in alphabetical order).
